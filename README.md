 <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The TCG Poképrix project is a personal project that had the goal of first developing an application for a friend. Its first goal was to be able to show the stock price of pokemon cards over time. Starting from a simple challenge, here I am with a rather complete version of the latter.
I would like to thank https://pokemontcg.io/ and its founder __Andrew Backes__ for letting me use his API which has been very helpful!

The goal is also to be able to propose this application on the google play store, so that everyone can manage in his quest to sell pokemon cards.
